### Completed Tasks
- ✅ Defined database schema with Prisma
- ✅ Created server package configuration
- ✅ Implemented error handling middleware
- ✅ Implemented request logging middleware
- ✅ Created token utility functions for JWT management
- ✅ Set up structured logging system
- ✅ Implemented authentication controller with all required endpoints
- ✅ Added authentication routes with proper Swagger documentation
- ✅ Implemented authentication middleware for route protection
- ✅ Created placeholder routes for services
- ✅ Created placeholder routes for clients with authorization
- ✅ Created placeholder routes for state transfers
- ✅ Created log routes with buffer handling
- ✅ Updated package.json with required TypeScript type definitions
- ✅ Fixed TypeScript implicit 'any' type errors in all route handler files
- ✅ Created custom type definitions for Express Request interface extensions
- ✅ Created custom enums for Prisma models (UserRole, ClientStatus, etc.)
- ✅ Created placeholder routes for content and resource endpoints (blog, resources, etc.)
- ✅ Revised enum type definitions to match Prisma schema (OBSERVER instead of USER)
- ✅ Fixed TypeScript errors related to JWT token generation
- ✅ Tested complete authentication flow with login, protected routes, and token refresh
- ✅ Tested token revocation functionality to ensure proper invalidation


#### Recent Changes (2025-03-19)
1. **Fixed JWT token sign TypeScript errors**
   - Corrected the typing for JWT sign options to use proper numeric values for expiresIn
   - Added proper type casting for JWT secret using the Secret type from jsonwebtoken
   - Fixed token model creation to include all required fields (security version, token)
   - Updated token revocation logic to use revokedAt field instead of revoked

2. **Resolved UserRole type mismatch**
   - Identified discrepancy between Prisma's UserRole enum and custom type definition
   - Prisma schema defined UserRole as ADMIN, STAFF, CLIENT, OBSERVER
   - Custom type incorrectly used USER instead of OBSERVER
   - Updated prisma.types.ts to match Prisma schema, ensuring type compatibility

3. **Fixed Token model field errors**
   - Updated references to non-existent "revoked" field to use "revokedAt" (datetime field)
   - Ensured required fields are correctly included during token creation (userId, type, token, securityVersion, expiresAt)

4. **Server now running without TypeScript errors**
   - Successfully fixed all compilation errors
   - Server now starts properly on port 4000
   - Ready for testing authentication flow with real API endpoints

#### Next Development Steps (Detailed)
1. Implement complete logout functionality to properly revoke tokens
2. Finalize refresh token rotation with proper error handling for expired/revoked tokens
3. Implement user profile and settings pages in the frontend
4. Complete the service management endpoints with proper validation

### Areas of Concern
- Authentication flow needs comprehensive testing with the centralized error handler
- Enum implementation as string literals is necessary to match API specification exactly
- Content endpoints are needed to unblock frontend Resource Hub development
- NPM package vulnerabilities need to be addressed before production deployment
- TypeScript configuration needs to be properly set up for both frontend and backend

### Debugging Patterns
- API response validation should follow the standard pattern defined in api.types.ts
- All authentication-related actions must be properly logged in the audit trail
- Error logging must include the request ID for correlation
- Authorization checks must be enforced for all protected resources
- TypeScript strict mode enforces type safety throughout the codebase
- Frontend now translates all API errors to user-friendly messages
- Backend error details are only logged, never exposed directly to clients
- Environment variables are carefully handled to work in both development and production

## Implementation Notes

### Authentication System
The authentication system uses a dual-token approach with:
- Access Token (24-hour lifetime, HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict cookie)
- Refresh Token (14-day lifetime, HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict cookie, single-use with rotation)
  - On /api/auth/refresh, a new access token AND new refresh token are issued
  - Old refresh token is invalidated after a 5-minute grace period to prevent race conditions
  - Security version is included in tokens and incremented on password change, role change, or forced reset






  ### Frontend Architecture
The frontend now has a basic architecture with:
- React 18 with TypeScript support
- Tailwind CSS for styling (configured with tailwind.config.js and postcss.config.js)
- Axios for API requests with interceptors for error handling
- UUID for generating correlation IDs
- Context API for state management
- Custom hooks for reusable logic
- Type-safe environment variable handling
