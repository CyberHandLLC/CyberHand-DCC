### Encountered Errors
- TypeScript errors related to missing type definitions for various packages
  - Resolution: Added proper type definitions in package.json
- TypeScript implicit 'any' errors in Express route handlers
  - Resolution: Added explicit type annotations (Request, Response, NextFunction)
- UserRole import errors from @prisma/client
  - Resolution: Created custom type definitions in prisma.types.ts
- **Inconsistency in refresh token implementation** - RESOLVED
  - Resolution: Fixed TypeScript errors in JWT token generation
  - Tested the cookie-based authentication flow with both access and refresh tokens
  - Confirmed token rotation is working correctly with HttpOnly cookies
- **Custom enum values may not match API specification**
  - Resolution: Replaced enum objects with string literal types (e.g., type UserRole = 'ADMIN' | 'STAFF' | 'CLIENT')
  - Created UserRoles constants for type-safe references in code
- **Missing content and resource endpoints**
  - Resolution: Added placeholder routes for blog, resources, and other content endpoints
- **Missing React, Axios, and UUID type definitions in frontend**
  - Resolution: Installed required dependencies and their TypeScript type definitions
  - `npm install --save axios uuid`
  - `npm install --save-dev @types/react @types/node @types/uuid`
- **PowerShell command concatenation issues**
  - Resolution: Had to run each npm install command separately, as PowerShell doesn't support the '&&' operator like bash
- **NPM package vulnerabilities detected**
  - 8 vulnerabilities (2 moderate, 6 high) reported during dependency installation
  - Resolution: Attempted `npm audit fix` but it requires breaking changes; will need to address later
- **Prisma schema validation errors**
  - Error: Field-level `@index` attributes were causing validation errors in Prisma 5.22.0
  - Resolution: Moved field-level `@index` attributes to model-level `@@index([field])` declarations
- **JWT token generation TypeScript errors**
  - Error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number | StringValue | undefined'
  - Resolution: Changed string literal token expiration ('24h', '14d') to numeric seconds (24*60*60, 14*24*60*60)
  - Properly typed JWT sign options using SignOptions interface from jsonwebtoken
  - Added type casting for JWT secret to match the required Secret type
- **UserRole enum type mismatch**
  - Error: Type 'import("prisma.types").UserRole' is not assignable to type 'import("@prisma/client").$Enums.UserRole'
  - Specific issue: 'USER' role existed in custom type but not in Prisma schema enum (which has 'OBSERVER')
  - Resolution: Updated the custom UserRole type in prisma.types.ts to match Prisma schema definition
  - Changed 'USER' to 'OBSERVER' in the UserRoles constant object

### Progress Details

#### Recent Changes (2025-03-19)
1. **Fixed JWT token sign TypeScript errors**
   - Corrected the typing for JWT sign options to use proper numeric values for expiresIn
   - Added proper type casting for JWT secret using the Secret type from jsonwebtoken
   - Fixed token model creation to include all required fields (security version, token)
   - Updated token revocation logic to use revokedAt field instead of revoked

2. **Resolved UserRole type mismatch**
   - Identified discrepancy between Prisma's UserRole enum and custom type definition
   - Prisma schema defined UserRole as ADMIN, STAFF, CLIENT, OBSERVER
   - Custom type incorrectly used USER instead of OBSERVER
   - Updated prisma.types.ts to match Prisma schema, ensuring type compatibility

3. **Fixed Token model field errors**
   - Updated references to non-existent "revoked" field to use "revokedAt" (datetime field)
   - Ensured required fields are correctly included during token creation (userId, type, token, securityVersion, expiresAt)

4. **Server now running without TypeScript errors**
   - Successfully fixed all compilation errors
   - Server now starts properly on port 4000
   - Ready for testing authentication flow with real API endpoints

#### Next Development Steps (Detailed)
1. Implement complete logout functionality to properly revoke tokens
2. Finalize refresh token rotation with proper error handling for expired/revoked tokens
3. Implement user profile and settings pages in the frontend
4. Complete the service management endpoints with proper validation

### Areas of Concern
- Authentication flow needs comprehensive testing with the centralized error handler
- Enum implementation as string literals is necessary to match API specification exactly
- Content endpoints are needed to unblock frontend Resource Hub development
- NPM package vulnerabilities need to be addressed before production deployment
- TypeScript configuration needs to be properly set up for both frontend and backend

### Debugging Patterns
- API response validation should follow the standard pattern defined in api.types.ts
- All authentication-related actions must be properly logged in the audit trail
- Error logging must include the request ID for correlation
- Authorization checks must be enforced for all protected resources
- TypeScript strict mode enforces type safety throughout the codebase
- Frontend now translates all API errors to user-friendly messages
- Backend error details are only logged, never exposed directly to clients
- Environment variables are carefully handled to work in both development and production

## Implementation Notes

### Authentication System
The authentication system uses a dual-token approach with:
- Access Token (24-hour lifetime, HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict cookie)
- Refresh Token (14-day lifetime, HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict cookie, single-use with rotation)
  - On /api/auth/refresh, a new access token AND new refresh token are issued
  - Old refresh token is invalidated after a 5-minute grace period to prevent race conditions
  - Security version is included in tokens and incremented on password change, role change, or forced reset

### Frontend Error Handling (COMPLETED)
The frontend error handling system now:
- Intercepts all API errors through a centralized error handler
- Maps backend error codes/messages to user-friendly messages
- Logs the full error details to the backend logging system
- Never exposes raw error messages or technical details to users
- Includes consistent error rendering components across the application
- Maintains correlation IDs throughout the request lifecycle
- Provides React context and hooks for easy integration in components
- Automatically dismisses non-critical errors after a timeout

Implementation includes:
- ErrorContext.tsx - Global error state management through React Context
- ErrorNotifications.tsx - Component to display error notifications to users
- errorHandler.ts - Core error handling utility functions
- useErrorHandler.ts - Custom hook for components to use error handling
- apiClient.ts - API client with built-in error handling via interceptors
- App.tsx - Main app component with error provider integration
- ErrorHandlingExample.tsx - Example component demonstrating error handling usage
- global.d.ts - Type declarations for proper TypeScript support

### Frontend Architecture
The frontend now has a basic architecture with:
- React 18 with TypeScript support
- Tailwind CSS for styling (configured with tailwind.config.js and postcss.config.js)
- Axios for API requests with interceptors for error handling
- UUID for generating correlation IDs
- Context API for state management
- Custom hooks for reusable logic
- Type-safe environment variable handling

### Frontend Authentication Implementation
The frontend authentication system has been successfully implemented with the following components:

1. **Authentication Service** (authService.ts)
   - Centralized API interactions for authentication
   - Login, logout, registration, and token management
   - Built on the standardized API response format

2. **Authentication Context** (AuthContext.tsx)
   - Global state provider for authentication status
   - User data and authentication methods
   - Proper error handling and state management
   - Automatic user loading on application start

3. **Authentication Components**
   - Login component with form validation
   - Registration component with comprehensive validation
   - Protected route wrapper for securing routes
   - Role-based access control
   - Unauthorized access page
   - Dashboard with role-specific content

4. **App Integration**
   - React Router configured with protected routes
   - Role-based route protection
   - Public vs. authenticated route separation
   - Default route redirection
   - Integration with existing error handling system

The implementation follows the frontend authentication guide and adheres to CyberHand's layered error handling approach with client-side validation, consistent error messages, and user-friendly notifications.

### Database Initialization (COMPLETED)
The database has been successfully initialized with:
- Prisma migration created and applied to set up all database tables
- PostgreSQL database running and properly configured
- Fixed Prisma schema validation errors by adjusting index definitions
- All required tables created according to the defined schema
- Connection parameters properly configured in the .env file
- Seed data created for testing with sample users, services, and clients:
  - Users: admin, staff, and client with appropriate roles
  - Services: Security Audit, Managed IT, and Cloud Migration
  - Client: TechCorp Solutions with contacts and service subscriptions

### Type System Implementation
For proper API alignment:
- Replaced enum objects with TypeScript string literal types
- Ensured exact string values match API specification (e.g., 'ADMIN' not ADMIN)
- Updated route files to use the new UserRoles constants
- Maintaining consistent type definitions between frontend and backend
- Created global type declarations for environment variables and Node.js process

## Action Items
- ‚úÖ Test the refresh token handling in /api/auth/refresh (confirmed working properly)
- ‚úÖ Test the token revocation in /api/auth/revoke to ensure tokens are properly invalidated
- ‚è±Ô∏è Implement content and resource frontend components
- ‚è±Ô∏è Address NPM package vulnerabilities in frontend dependencies

## Testing Notes
As per CyberHand standards, all testing uses real APIs and the production database to ensure consistency with the live environment. No mocks or separate test models are permitted. All progress is continuously tracked in this file with notes, timestamps, and actionable insights.
