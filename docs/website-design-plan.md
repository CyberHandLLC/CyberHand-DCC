  - Touch-friendly interface elements
  - Optimized images for mobile connections

- **Breakpoints**:
  - Mobile: 320px - 767px
  - Tablet: 768px - 1023px
  - Desktop: 1024px - 1439px
  - Large Desktop: 1440px+

- **Service Tier Responsiveness**:
  - Horizontal tier comparisons on desktop
  - Vertical, swipeable tier cards on mobile
  - Collapsible feature lists on smaller screens
  - Consistent CTA placement across screen sizes

## Accessibility Considerations

- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance**:
  - Proper heading hierarchy
  - Adequate color contrast
  - Alternative text for all service imagery
  - Keyboard navigation for service exploration
  - ARIA labels for interactive service elements

- **Service Information Accessibility**:
  - Clear categorization of services
  - Consistent presentation of tiers
  - Screen reader optimization for feature lists
  - Alternative formats for pricing and feature comparisons

## Integration with Authentication System

- **Seamless Transitions**:
  - Public site to login/registration pages
  - Consistent styling between public and authenticated areas
  - Preservation of service selection through authentication
  - Role-based redirects after authentication (CLIENT, ADMIN, STAFF, OBSERVER)

- **Client-Specific Functionality**:
  - Service browsing to service activation flow
  - Service tier upgrades for existing clients
  - Client-specific dashboard access
  - Integration with clientId validation as described in authentication guide

- **Authentication State Persistence**:
  - Store selected service/tier in localStorage before redirect to login
  - Retrieve and apply stored selections after successful authentication
  - Implement a dedicated StateTransferService to manage pre/post-auth context
  - Pass selected service IDs via URL parameters when linking to login page
  - Ensure deep linking capability for direct navigation to specific service tiers post-login
  - Clear temporary state storage after successful transfer to authenticated context

- **StateTransferService Implementation Details**:
  - **Data Storage**: 
    - Primary: localStorage with namespace prefix `ch_statetransfer_`
    - Fallback: URL parameters for essential context (e.g., `?selectedService=serv123&tier=business`)
    - Encryption for sensitive data using AES-GCM with secure key management
  
  - **Encryption Key Strategy**:
    - Key generation: Use Web Crypto API to generate a strong 256-bit AES key at session start
    - Key storage: Temporary session storage (cleared on browser close)
    - Key rotation: New key generated on each new session
    - Key protection: Key never persisted to disk storage
    - Session validation: HMAC verification of session integrity
    - Fallback: Non-sensitive data only if encryption unavailable
  
  - **Data Format**:
    - JSON structure with standardized schema:
    ```typescript
    interface TransferState {
      timestamp: number;           // Expiration management
      origin: string;              // Source page path
      serviceContext?: {
        selectedServiceId?: string;
        selectedTierId?: string;
        packageId?: string;
        customOptions?: Record<string, unknown>;
      };
      marketingContext?: {
        referralSource?: string;
        campaign?: string;
      };
      userContext?: {
        partialProfile?: Record<string, string>;
      };
    }
    ```
    
  - **API Methods**:
    - `storeState(stateKey: string, data: Partial<TransferState>): void`
    - `retrieveState(stateKey: string): TransferState | null`
    - `appendToState(stateKey: string, data: Partial<TransferState>): void`
    - `clearState(stateKey?: string): void` // Clear specific or all states
    - `transferStateToQueryParams(stateKey: string): string` // For URL building
    - `extractStateFromQueryParams(): Partial<TransferState> | null`
  
  - **Lifecycle Management**:
    - State expiration after 30 minutes (configurable)
    - Automatic cleanup of expired states on service initialization
    - Event listeners for successful authentication to trigger state transfer
    - De-duplication of redundant state data

- **Backend Authentication Dependencies**:
  - Explicit dependency on HttpOnly cookie implementation from backend
  - Integration with JWT refresh token mechanism
  - Alignment with authentication flow described in frontend-auth-guide.md
  - Session timeout handling and graceful re-authentication

## Error Handling and Logging

- **Frontend Error Boundary Implementation**:
  - React Error Boundaries for component-level error capture
  - Global error handler for unhandled exceptions
  - User-friendly error messages with recovery options

- **Logging Strategy**:
  - **IndexedDB Log Buffer Implementation**:
    - Log entries stored in structured format with timestamp, level, context, and message
    - Automatic buffer management with configurable size limit (default 1000 entries)
    - Synchronization schedule:
      - Regular logs: 5-minute fixed interval flush to backend
      - Critical errors: Immediate flush attempt (ERROR and FATAL levels)
      - Connectivity-aware: Pauses schedule when offline, resumes with backlog on reconnection
      - Page visibility aware: Reduced frequency when tab is not visible
    - Log persistence across page refreshes and browser restarts
    - Privacy controls for sensitive information
    - Log rotation to prevent excessive storage usage
    - Export capabilities for debugging purposes
  
  - **Logging Levels and Destinations**:
    - Development: Console output + IndexedDB buffer 
    - Production: IndexedDB buffer with backend synchronization when available
    - Critical errors: Immediate synchronization attempts with exponential backoff
  
  - **Backend Integration Timeline**:
    - Initial: All logs to IndexedDB buffer
    - When available: Synchronization with backend /api/logs endpoint
    - Future enhancement: Sentry for comprehensive error tracking
