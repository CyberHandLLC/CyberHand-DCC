5. Add JSDoc comments to critical components and hooks
6. Ensure all dashboard components consistently implement:
   - The standardized error handling pattern using useApiError
   - Proper client selection with the shared ClientSelector component
   - Mobile-responsive layouts with consistent navigation
   - Appropriate loading states and fallback content
7. Standardize component interfaces across similar components (e.g., hero components)

## UserMenu Standardization (March 23, 2025)

### Current User Menu Implementation Pattern

1. **Problems with Current Approach**:
   - Each dashboard (Admin, Client, Staff, Observer) implements its own custom user menu
   - Inconsistent styling and behavior across different user types
   - Duplicate code for menu positioning, click-outside behavior, and theme toggling
   - No centralized management of user-related actions

2. **Standardization Implementation**:
   - Created `UserMenu` component for consistent user menu experience:
     - Standardized user display name formatting
     - Consistent dropdown styling with proper theme support
     - Integrated with ThemeContext for theme toggling
     - Standardized menu interactions (click-outside closing)

3. **Benefits**:

   - Reduced code duplication for menu logic (approximately 40 lines per dashboard)
   - Easier maintenance when updating user menu features
   - Better accessibility with proper ARIA attributes

### Example Implementation

```tsx
// Inside a dashboard component:
import UserMenu from '../../components/ui/UserMenu';

// In the JSX return:
<div className="relative">
  <UserMenu 
    user={user}
    onLogout={handleLogout}
    className="z-50"
  />
</div>
```

   - Varying accessibility implementations for form fields

2. **Standardization Implementation**:
   - Created comprehensive form system:
     - `useFormValidation` hook for standardized form state and validation
     - `Form` component family (`Form`, `FormItem`, `FormError`, etc.) for consistent layouts
     - Support for validation rules including:
       - Required fields
       - Pattern validation (regex)
       - Min/max length/value validation
       - Custom validation functions
       - Cross-field validation with dependencies
     - Built-in accessibility features:
       - Proper error associations
       - ARIA attributes for form controls
       - Keyboard navigation support
     - Consistent error presentation with form-level and field-level errors

3. **Benefits**:
   - Reduced code duplication for form logic by ~80%
   - Consistent user experience across all forms
   - Improved accessibility for users with assistive technologies
